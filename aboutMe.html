    <p class="card-text">I’m interested in learning algorithms for neural networks both as models of computation in the brain and as machine learning and artificial intelligence tools. During my PhD I hope to contribute to the understanding of unsupervised dynamics in neural nets and how they facilitate discovery of immediate and latent features of its input, as well as maintenance of relevant information from the past: memory.</p>
